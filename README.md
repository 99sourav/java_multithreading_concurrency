Introduction

Multithreading and concurrency are essential topics in modern software development.
This repository provides practical examples, tutorials, and best practices for managing threads, synchronizing tasks, and optimizing concurrent code in Java.

Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/99sourav/java_multithreading_concurrency.git

Explore the examples: Navigate through the different directories to find various examples demonstrating multithreading and concurrency concepts.

Run the code: Use your preferred Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) to run the examples.

Examples

This repository includes a variety of examples:

Basic Thread Creation: Learn how to create and start threads.

Thread Synchronization: Techniques for synchronizing access to shared resources.

Thread Pools: Efficiently managing multiple threads using thread pools.

Concurrency Utilities: Using Java’s java.util.concurrent package for advanced concurrency control.

Best Practices

Follow these best practices for working with multithreading and concurrency in Java:

Minimize shared mutable state to avoid race conditions.

Use synchronization mechanisms wisely to prevent deadlocks.

Leverage Java’s concurrency utilities (ExecutorService, CountDownLatch, etc.) to manage threads efficiently.

Profile and test concurrent code to ensure performance and correctness.
